**Allow users to interact with items outside the display**

We currently rely on monitors to display all the information to us, but this means we are limited by the size of the screen. Using position trackers on a glove users are able to point to outside the screen and control the content. This means that interactive aspects of a webpage, application, etc can be controlled regardless of how big the screen size is.
