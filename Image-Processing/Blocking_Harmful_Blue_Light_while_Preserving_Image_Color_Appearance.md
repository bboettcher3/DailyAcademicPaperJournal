**F.lux but it looks normal and not super red**

The range of what we see as "blue" is wide and the if you just elminate the harmful "blue light" that peaks at the certain frequency you can still retain the "blue" color we expect. The biggest issues is this is all currently done in software and the processing is not ideal for its prototype phase. The biggest challenge is if the image has most its blue in the harmful "blue" peak frequency.
