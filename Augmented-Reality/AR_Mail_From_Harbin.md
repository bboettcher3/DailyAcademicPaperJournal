**AR Markers of places on back of postcards**

Using AR Marker technology and a well scanned mesh of a building, you can set the markers on the back of the postcard to allow people with the app to view what the building looks like. By having four cards you are also able to move them all together to complete the scan of the building and its surrounding. This was built with Unity and is currently available only from their website download site.
