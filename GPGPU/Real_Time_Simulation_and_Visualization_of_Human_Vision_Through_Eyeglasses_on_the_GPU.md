**Allow glasses to display realistic visuals**

This system is made to work on spheric, toric, and free-form lenses which allows for about all variation of common percription eyeglasses. By this they also know that the ray tracing involved will only ever need three bounces greatly reducing computation. The big issue is they used a desktop GPU while this would need to be something that can be powered by a mobile GPU for practical future uses.
