**GPUs are good at measuring video quality**

This paper is just some results showing that some CPU-based video quality measurement program worked almost twice as good when turned to GPU-based. This doesn't go into details what they made GPU-based, what memory limits they had, how large the data processed was, or really any details. The other thing is they used very old CPU and GPU to test with so the performance won't show in the real world currently.
