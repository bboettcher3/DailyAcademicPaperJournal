**High quantity simulation in browsers**

This was an attempt to see how to achieve mass crowd simulation at real-time rendering speed over the web. This took the idea of trying to make use of the limited features the browsers have to the GPU and parallelism. This didn't end up working without having to pre-compute and save it in a massive file to be read in.
