# Project-Digital-Donut

The one stop shop for a comprehensive set of tl;dr for research papers. The ultimate goal is to add one paper per day.

## Rules

- All entries must follow the [template](./template.md)
- Add only one paper per commit
  - Fixing a bunch of typos/grammar can be done in one big commit
  - Adding a new folder is fine as well in the same commit
- Keep it short, I can read the full paper if I wanted to
- Add sub-category folders when a need for seperation occurs
- Name each file with Title_of_Paper_With_Underscores.md
- Folder name are Name-With-Dashes
