**Turning 3D scans into 3D model video**

This is the idea of taking 3D scans, constructing a point cloud, creating a mesh, and be able to play it back as a video. This would allow you to insert this free-viewpoint object in an VR/AR application and walk around and see the video from any angle. This becomes a challenge from all the steps its takes and resources to get a single person for a few seconds.
