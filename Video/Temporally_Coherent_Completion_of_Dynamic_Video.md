**Cropping out people and objects from videos**

The goal of this was to be able to take a video clip and remove a person, object, etc from the video without having to mask it all by hand as currently done today. Using their flow algorithm and patch tables optimization, they have got pretty close to a well-working algorithm. The big limitation is the complexity and time it takes since it's all being done with exploiting GPUs.
