**Use both 2D and 3D stablization methods**

3D video stablization lacks the ability to crop the image out as a 2D video can. This is solved by turing video into a cube map, tracking key frames, and doing a second pass if needed. The biggest effect other then removing the jitter effect when watching in VR is the bit rate is substantially lowered due to less differences between frames.
