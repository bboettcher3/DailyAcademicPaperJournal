**A discussion of granular synthesis techniques**

Techniques for granularizing sampled sounds are discussed, and certain audio effects specific to granular synthesis are evaluated. One such effect, named the corner effect, results from the trapezoidal window of the spectra. It's named as such because the nature of the effect depends on the position of the corners of the window.
