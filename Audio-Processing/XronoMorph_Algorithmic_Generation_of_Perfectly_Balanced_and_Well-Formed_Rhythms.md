**Creating rhythms from geometric rules**

The authors present a program called XronoMorph, which creates rhythms that are "perfectly balanced" and "well-formed." These two properties are created through maintaining geometric rules. Polygons are inscribed in a circle, and the vertexes along the circle are considered triggers for notes. The circle rotates at a given speed, and the notes are played as they pass a certain point on the circle. The inscribed polygons maintain either perfectly balanced rhythms or well-formed rhythms.
