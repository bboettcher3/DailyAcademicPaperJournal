**Creating additional timbres for synthesis through blindly interpreting musical gestures**

Eric proposed a system to create sounds that weren't direct transformations of the input. By interpreting the musical gestures (frequency analysis) he could alter the input based on likelihood of certain harmonic structures within the input. Taking this data and putting it through a synthesis engine allows the creation of many different timbres not able to be created with direct transformations of the input.
