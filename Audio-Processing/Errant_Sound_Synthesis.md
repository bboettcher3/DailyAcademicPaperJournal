**Presentation of non-standard synthesis methods**

The author presents some methods of synthesis that can be used to create different sounds than what can be done with standard synthesizers. Utilizing biological and physics phenomena, synthesis models can be created. Recognizing mathematical patterns in natural models allow for new and adventurous synthesis techniques.
