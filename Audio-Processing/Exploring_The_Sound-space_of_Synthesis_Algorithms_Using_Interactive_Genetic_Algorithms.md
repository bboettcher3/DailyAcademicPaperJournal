**Synthesizing sounds interactively using a genetic evolutionary approach**

Using CSound for the synthesis, a technique in synthesis involving the user picking out which sounds are the closest to the target is discussed. The sounds that are closest to the target are used as parents for the next generation, and the cycle continues until the target is reached. This technique has advantages compared to other synthesizers because it allows a fairly hands-free approach to synthesis that doesn't require a complex knowledge of the program and sound design itself. CSound uses a granular synthesizer for this technique.
