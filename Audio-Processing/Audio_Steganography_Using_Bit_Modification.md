**Embedding covert messages without detection in audio tracks**

By changing lower bits of audio tracks, covert messages can be embedded without detection. It was stated that visual steganography is easier that audio because of the human's enhanced audio perception. Some problems associated with this is the noticeability of the changes and possible noise introduced in the transmission. It was found that even changing higher bits in the audio resulted in unnoticeable changes. Telephony and speech are easier to make larger changes in, but music is easier to detect changes in frequency. Accounting for noise is done by repeating bits and taking a majority vote among the repetitions.
