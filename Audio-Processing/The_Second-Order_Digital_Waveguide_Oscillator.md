**Waveguide oscillators explained for VSLI purposes**

3 techniques for creating waveguide oscillators are introduced. These techniques are easier for the system to complete as opposed to equivalent synthesis with additive methods. The techniques are explained for VLSI use and are good for FM synthesis methods.
