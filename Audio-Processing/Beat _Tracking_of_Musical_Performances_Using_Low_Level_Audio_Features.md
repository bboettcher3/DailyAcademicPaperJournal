**Creating a beat tracking algorithm using low level features in audio**

Creating separate rhythm tracks for audio features such as energy, group delay, spectral center and spectral dispersion allows one to use probabalistic methods to find where onsets of beats are in any given audio track. This rhythm track method is found to be faster and more efficient than using a particle filter for the same task. Specific calculations for each rhythm track are discussed.
