**Observations of coding and decoding audio signals in the MPEG-4 standard**

The processes of encoding audio into the frequency domain and decoding the frequency domain frames into audio again are discussed. Encoding is done with DFT's and other transforms for each frame of audio by parametrizing the signal into separate components (frequency, amplitude, phase). Decoding is done by taking each parameter and synthesizing its respective signal. Scalability is made possible by ordering the most important parameters to be decoded first in cases of poor transmission.
