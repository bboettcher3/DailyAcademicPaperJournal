**Multi-modal audio synchronization**

Techniques to synchronize different types of audio scores and formats are presented. For a given song, the goal is to synchronize MIDI, raw audio, the musical score, or any modes given so that easier categorization of the track is possible. This is done by detecting onsets on the chroma level and using them in combination with a synchronization algorithm to give a solution that is both robust and accurate.
