**Automating audio mastering through pitch tracking**

The goal of mastering is to improve the music by emphasizing important frequencies. A solution to automating this process is proposed by combining a pitch tracker with an equalizer. The pitch tracker finds the fundamental frequencies and how often they occur, and the equalizer emphasizes those which appear often. The solution is shown to improve unmastered audio, but is not compared to professionally mastered audio.
