**Separating songs into vocals, drums, bass, and other**

The researchers used a blend of feed-forward and bidirectional LSTM neural networks to compute separate intrument tracks for any given song. They found that blending the results of both networks showed considerable improvements, and also data augmentation for additional training appeared to help as well.
