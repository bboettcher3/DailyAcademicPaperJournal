**Creating rules for guided music composition**

In order to create realistic rhythms through a digital medium, you must place constraints on certain timings and patterns, such as the time it takes for a guitar pick to get from one note to another. The author placed these constraints, and used probabalistic methods to determine how strictly each constraint was enforced. The results showed music with impressive coherence.
