**Creating an efficient equalizer for inexperienced users based on aesthetic tastes**

Some users that aren't fully equipped with the knowledge of how to master and equalize music might be intimidated by professional equalizers, so a process of using describing words to preset equalization is introduced. The user is asked to rate audio clips according to words similar to "muddy", "bright" "tinny", etc. The user's decisions create presets for each describing word so that the user can simply ask for a "bright" equalization and it will be provided free of technical knowledge. This is done by analyzing the frequency spectrum of each clip that is played to the user, and then associate certain spectra to their respective describing word.
