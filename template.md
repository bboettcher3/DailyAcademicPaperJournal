**1 liner tl:dr**

The main summary which is ment to be short since I can read the actual paper to get the full idea. Really just rephrasing their abstract section for them from a new reader perpective. The X to the right of the title is the number of pages the paper is. This is used as a means to quick see how long it might take to read the paper.
