**1 liner tl:dr**

The main summary which is ment to be short since I can read the actual paper to get the full idea. Really just rephrasing their abstract section for them from a new reader perpective. The X to the right of the title is a rating of how difficult it was to read the paper from a techincal perpective. 1 X means anyone can understand it and 5 X's mean you need to know you crap about the topic prior to reading it to get anything out of it.
