**Using matrix manipulation techniques for pattern recognition**

Comparing Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to three other pattern recognition methods, the researchers explained how NMF worked and what the advantages of using NMF are. As opposed to methods that use wholistic approaches to pattern recognition, NMF uses sparse and distributed encodings that are combined to form a whole. The advantage of being non-negative is that the individual parts are meaningfully interpreted, instead of parts that can cancel out by being both postive and negative which don't lead to very meaningful parts.
