**Combining techniques to get better water splashing simulation**

There are many ways to go about fluid simulation and this aims to take a novel approach. By using unilateral incompressibility, mass-full FLIP, and obstacle handing they got increased results. The big issue is still there is no representation of the liquid surface with this method.
